# Problem Statement
The project aims to design and develop a computerized system to efficiently manage student records and attendance, replacing traditional manual methods. The current manual processes for handling student data, attendance, and exam marks are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack easy access for updates and analysis. The system will enable secure login, add/update/delete student details, mark and view attendance, analyze marks, and save/load data seamlessly using JSON files. This automation improves data accuracy, accessibility, and simplifies administrative tasks for users such as teachers and administrators.

# Scope of the project
The scope of the Student Management System project :
•	User login with authentication for secure access.
•	Add, display, search, update, and delete student records (roll no, name, age, marks).
•	Mark and view attendance (present/absent) for students.
•	Analyze marks: calculate average, list pass/fail students.
•	Save and load data using JSON files for persistence.
•	Console-based interactive menu-driven system.
•	Limited to basic record management; no GUI, multi-user support, or advanced reports.
•	Suitable for small-scale academic record handling and learning purposes.
This defines clear boundaries and core features for the project.

# Target users
The target users of the Student Management System project are:
•	School or college administrators who manage student records.
•	Teachers who track student attendance and academic performance.
•	Academic staff responsible for maintaining and analyzing marks and attendance.
•	Beginners or students learning programming and database management through practical projects.
These users benefit from a simple, secure, and interactive system for efficient student data handling and attendance management without needing advanced technical expertise.

# High-level features
The high-level features of this Student Management System project are:
•	Secure login authentication for authorized access.
•	Add, update, delete, and search student records (roll no, name, age, marks).
•	Mark and track student attendance (present or absent).
•	Display attendance summaries and statistics.
•	Analyze marks with average calculation and pass/fail listing.
•	Save and load student and attendance data from JSON files.
•	Interactive, menu-driven command-line interface.
These features cover essential student record management and basic academic tracking in a simple, accessible way suitable for small institutions or learning projects
